# Data_Visualization-Challenge
The first part of the challenge was straight forward since it was what we learned in our previous challenge (pandas). Plotting is easy once you know the right function and correct variables. I added steps that were not required to make it easier for me to see the data more clearly and analyse the little details. Furthermore, I debuged a couble of errors and played around with the colors and the different graph types. Overall, I would say that I still need alot more practice to master using matplotlib but I believe I am on the right track.
